- 👋 Hi, I’m @Immotay
- 👀 I’m interested in music, games and sports
- 🌱 I’m currently starting on programming through Python and I plan on moving on to the Data Science field at some point.
- 🙏 I would appreciate very much any C&C or tips you throw at me, as long as it isn't something too advanced for my current level
